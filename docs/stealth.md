# Stealth & Detection Evasion

## Why This Exists

Every browser automation tool based on Chromium has the same fundamental problem: Chrome DevTools Protocol. CDP is how Playwright, Puppeteer, and Selenium talk to the browser, and it's also how bot detection services know you're automated. You can install stealth plugins, patch `navigator.webdriver`, and spoof fingerprints all day — CDP is still there, and services like Cloudflare, DataDome, PerimeterX, and Akamai will find it.

This container takes a completely different approach:

- **Camoufox** (custom Firefox fork) instead of Chromium — there is no CDP to detect because Firefox doesn't use it
- **PyAutoGUI** for mouse and keyboard — input happens at the OS level, not through the browser's automation API. The browser genuinely doesn't know it's being automated. No JavaScript in the world can tell the difference between PyAutoGUI and a real human
- **Real fingerprints** via browserforge — no spoofing means no inconsistencies between the main context and web workers (a common detection vector)
- Everything packaged in a single Docker container — one command to run

## Two Input Modes

Understanding the difference between these is key to not getting detected.

### System Input — Undetectable

Actions: `system_click`, `mouse_move`, `mouse_click`, `system_type`, `send_key`, `scroll`

These use PyAutoGUI to generate **real OS-level events**. The mouse physically moves across the virtual screen with human-like curves and jitter. The keyboard generates real keystroke events. The browser has absolutely no way to know these aren't from a real human sitting at a computer.

System input uses **viewport coordinates**. `get_interactive_elements` returns each element's center as `x`/`y` and dimensions as `w`/`h`. Pass all four unchanged to `system_click`; it chooses a fresh point inside the central 60% of the element, avoiding borders and previously used positions for that box.

### Playwright Input — Detectable But Convenient

Actions: `click`, `fill`, `type`

These use Playwright's DOM automation to find elements by **CSS selector or XPath** and dispatch events through the browser's API. Faster and easier (no coordinate math), but the event injection patterns are theoretically detectable by sophisticated behavioral analysis.

### Which to Use

- **Default:** use `click` with a CSS selector. It's fast, reliable, and works for most sites.
- **Site explicitly detects and blocks DOM event injection?** Fall back to system input.
- **Using `system_click`?** Call `calibrate` first, then pass `x`, `y`, `w`, and `h` unchanged. Never add half the width or height to the center coordinates.
- **Filling forms on a protected site?** `fill` first; if blocked, `system_click` to focus then `system_type`.
- **Just scraping?** Playwright input (`click`, `fill`) is fine.

## Why It Actually Works

Most stealth tools try to **hide** automation signals. This container **doesn't have them in the first place**:

- **No CDP** — Firefox doesn't have Chrome DevTools Protocol. There's nothing to hide because it doesn't exist.
- **No fingerprint spoofing** — The fingerprint is generated once and applied consistently. Main context matches web workers (a common detection vector for spoofers).
- **`navigator.webdriver` is `false`** — Not patched to return false, it's genuinely false because Camoufox doesn't set it.
- **Real input events** — PyAutoGUI generates OS-level mouse and keyboard events. No DOM event injection for the browser to detect.

## AI Agent Integration

This project ships as a skill in `.skills/` — AI agents that support skills can pick it up and use the browser on demand. Start the container, set the env var, and the agent handles the rest.

```bash
export STEALTHY_AUTO_BROWSE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Claude Code

The `.skills/` directory in this repo is all Claude Code needs. Clone/copy this repo (or just the `.skills/` dir) into your project and Claude Code will automatically discover the skill.
